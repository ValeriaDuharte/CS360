The Weight Tracker app was created to help users monitor their daily weight, set goals, and stay motivated in a simple, user-friendly way. It addresses the need for personal progress tracking without overwhelming the user with unnecessary features. The app includes a secure login and registration screen, a main screen that displays weight entries in a grid, and input fields for adding, updating, or deleting entries. An optional SMS notification feature congratulates users when they reach a goal weight, but the app continues to function fully if permission is denied. The UI was designed with clarity and ease of use in mind, using consistent colors, layout groupings, and intuitive navigation to make the experience straightforward and visually appealing.

In developing the app, I focused on modular design with separate activities and a dedicated DatabaseHelper class for SQLite operations. I used iterative coding and testing in the Android Emulator to catch errors early and ensure functionality, especially for database interactions and user input validation. Challenges included managing activity navigation, linking UI elements, and handling optional permissions, which required careful planning and debugging. The component I am most successful in is the main activity and database integration, where I connected the UI to the database, enabling dynamic adding, updating, and deleting of entries. Overall, this project strengthened my skills in user-centered design, structured coding, and full-cycle app development, which I can apply in future mobile projects.
